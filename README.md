# Python Data Analysis Practice

This repository contains Python programs that solve real-world
data analysis and statistical problems.

The focus areas include:
### 1. restore_missing_sales.py
Restores missing sales values using the mean of available data.

### 2. event_popularity_mode.py
Identifies the most popular events using frequency (mode).

### 3. abnormal_temperature_detection.py
Flags abnormal patient temperatures using standard deviation thresholds.

### 4. top_percentile_students.py
Identifies top-performing students based on percentile calculation.

### 5. non_standard_pricing_detection.py
Detects franchise outlets with abnormal pricing behavior.

### 6. price_time_correlation.py
Analyzes the strength of correlation between pricing and user engagement.

### 7. portfolio_risk_analysis.py
Evaluates financial portfolio risk using variance and standard deviation.

### 8. stress_linked_sleep_patterns.py
Detects stress-linked users by correlating heart rate and sleep duration.

These programs demonstrate practical data handling,
clean logic, and statistical reasoning using Python.
